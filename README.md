# hasgel

My project for learning Haskell and OpenGL.

The project aims to implement the classic game, Space Invaders. As this is my
first larger project with Haskell, the scope of the game will (hopefully) be
kept at the minimum.

## Planned Features

The following features are planned. For a more detailed overview, check the
`Design.md` file.

  * A 3D model for player.
  * A model for regular alien ships and another model for the special ship.
  * Simple shooting animation.
  * A laser shot effect.
  * An explosion animation.
  * Destructible, defensive blockades.
  * Scoreboard
  * Demo recording and playing.
  * Rebindable keys.
